Quick Image Viewer (qiv) version 1.8  by Adam Kopacz / KLOGRAFX.DE Network
http://www.klografx.net/qiv/ - adam.k@klografx.de - Released on: 16.07.2002
===========================================================================


Installation (Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD):
-------------------------------------

 Solaris Users: please rename "Makefile.Solaris" to "Makefile" if the
 default Makefile doesn't work for you. 
 
 Various compile-time options are in the Makefile; be sure to at least
 read over them before typing "make install"... :)

 if you get errors like this: "/bin/sh: imlib-config: command not
 found" then your Imlib is to old.. this mean you don't have the
 script imlib-config..  you should update Imlib (see "Links" below) or
 replace the `imlib-config` calls in the Makefile:

 `imlib-config --cflags-gdk` -->
 -I/usr/X11R6/include -I/usr/local/lib/glib/include -I/usr/local/include \
 -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/X11R6/include

 `imlib-config --libs-gdk` -->
 -L/usr/local/lib -lgdk_imlib -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lgtk-1.1 \
 -lgdk-1.1 -rdynamic -lgmodule-1.1 -lglib-1.1 -ldl -lXi -lXext -lX11 -lm \
 -ljpeg -ltiff -lgif -lpng -lz -lm

 If you want to use qiv as a screensaver so please type 
 "make install-xscreensaver"
 

Other OSes:
----------

 Try the Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD stuff.. it would be nice if you could drop 
 me some lines if qiv work also on other systems (HP-UX?) ...

Misc:
-----

  Thanx to all programers, Owen Taylor and Rasterman (@REDHAT)
  for helping with patches and their knowledge :-)

  type "man qiv" for more information.
  See the Makefile if you have problems compiling.

  qiv is designed to work with any gtk/gdk, it also
  should work with ANY version of Imlib of Linux (Intel/Mac),
  Solaris (SunOS) and FreeBSD.


Centering:
----------

  As of version 1.7, qiv centers images by applying the correct window
  position and setting the window gravity to Static, so that window
  managers don't move the window when adding borders. If you come
  across a window manager that does mess up our centering, or has
  other problems with qiv, email Decklin (decklin@red-bean.com) and
  he'll quickly send off a patch to whoever maintains that WM. ;-)


Thumbnails:
-----------

  i don't plan on adding a thumbnail function.  sorry, but qiv is a
  QUICK image VIEWER and nothing more.  if you want more features
  (with Imlib) then try Electric Eyes or gqview ...

  
Image caching:
--------------

  if you want image caching then find the line at the top of image.c
  which says 'gdk_imlib_kill_image(q->im);', and change 'kill' to
  'destroy'. Don't forget to set your cache sizes with imlib_config!
  This stuff doesn't work right here (imlib 1.8 cvs) and on a imlib
  1.7 system so i have disabled it.


Speeding Up qiv:
----------------

  If you have a Pentium CPU and a recent copy of GCC, try enabling
  "-march=pentium" in the Makefile. "pentiumpro", "k6", and "athlon"
  can also be used in place of "pentium".

  The program "imlib_config" can be used to create an .imrc file with
  settings tuned for faster rendering. We recommend turning on these
  options:

  [x] High Quality in 15/16 bpp
  [x] Limit Maximum Shared Memory: 4 MB
  [x] Use Ordered Dither
  [x] MIT-SHM
  [x] Shared Pixmaps
  [x] Fast render
  [x] Imagemagick & NETPBM Fallback
  [x] Image Cache: 4 MB (or more)
  [x] Pixmap Cache: 40 Mbits (or more)

  After setting this stuff you can try: "qiv -d 0 *.jpg" (delay: 0
  secs) in a directory with for example 5 jpeg files. push "s" to
  start the slideshow and wait a few secs..  after all images are
  shown the first time (and cached) you should notice a big speed up
  in the second run.
